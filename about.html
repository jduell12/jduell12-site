                Hello! My name is Jessica and I am currently a student at Oregon
                State University studying Computer Science. I first got
                interested in becoming a software developer when a friend
                asked me to take a free bootcamp with him. I fell in love
                with developing software every since!
             </p>

               <p>
                 After getting my feet wet with the bootcamp I decided to pursue some
                 college courses at my local community college while working. I completed
                 my Associate's degree from Washtenaw Community College in Computer
                 Science: Programming in Java. After I completed the Associate's degree
                 I decided I wanted a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Since I
                 needed to work while going to school I chose Oregon State Univeristy's online
                 program.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The main languages I enjoy working in is C++ and Java. I am working
                  on honing my skills in Python as well as JavaScript. I have experience working
                  with Mac and Microsoft systems as well as the Linux environment.
                </p>
